For communication and discussion.

‚úÖTO THE STUDENTS:

If you are the student of JiLin University Department of Information Engineering, you could use the files freely.

I wrote 89% of these files, the remain is the copy of the INTERNET.

‚ùåNot ALL experiments included. I didn't backup anything, and I don't think all the experiments are needed the codes. Sometimes you need to push yourselves write something then you get improvements. 

From the start, you are required to:

  -have a great command in English.
  
  -have the basic skills to operate MATLAB/C++/C projects.
  
  -be nice to strangers.
  
I don't really have time to manage the repository, so I will just keep uploading the original files I wrote. Don't worry, it contains annotation.

If you don't know which file is the file you want, I suggest:

  -download the whole folder.
  
  -check the latest experiment guidebook, and ensure the experiment contents.
  
  -read the annotation.
  
üìåTo avoid being detected to plagiarize, I ask you to change the dataset I use. It was also in the .txt file in every folder. 

    -How to change the data? That's the reason I ask you to "have the basic skills to operate MATLAB/C++/C projects".
    
In the end, I hope you guys can have a good grades.

‚úÖTO THE DEVELOPERS:

I know I'm not a good programmer, so if you find out where I need to improve, I will check it out, but not that soon LOL.
